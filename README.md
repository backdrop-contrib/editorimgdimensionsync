# Editor Image Dimension Sync

This small module enhances the CKEditor image selection dialog.

It synchronizes the image dimensions while editing, to preserve the image ratio.

Additionally provides a button to reset to the original image dimensions when
 they have been changed.

There are no settings, just enable the module and the functionality will be
there.
